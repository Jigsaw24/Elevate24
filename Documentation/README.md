# Getting Started 

Elevate24 gives your team the power to grant limited privileges to certain users for a limited period of time through a simple self-service request. This allows users to access the admin permissions they need for their role while still maintaining security restrictions and avoiding the pitfalls of a completely open privileges system.

To get started, you can simply follow the guidance below:

## Deploy

First, Elevate24 needs to be deployed to your test devices before rolling it out to production. Simply follow the deployment instructions for your MDM solution. A few examples are provided below:

- [Install and deployment](/Documentation/Install%20and%20deployment.md)

After the application is installed, Elevate24 will launch in **basic** mode with default configurations. To test additional configurations, try the `basic-com.jigsaw24.Elevate24` profile and `com.apple.notificationsettings` for enabling notifications found in the folder below:

- [Template profiles](/Template%20Profiles/)

## Configure

Once you are satisfied that the templated profile is working as expected, you can adjust the options to suit your organisationâ€™s needs. Alternatively, you can create a custom settings configuration using the iMazing Profile Editor application.
